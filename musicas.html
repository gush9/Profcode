        <h4>Letting Go</h4>
        <h5>Angie McMahon</h5>

        I might've spent six months lying on my living room floor<br>
        I might've been sick, then well, then sick some more<br>
        I might be prouder of me<br>
        Than I ever have been<br>
        I've been learning 'bout letting go<br>
        How to do it without my claws<br>
        Scratching the surfaces<br>
        I've been learning 'bout wasting time<br>
        And closing some doors<br>
        Hoping to open more, down the line<br>
        I knew from miles away that I would detonate<br>
        I tried some magic tricks to skip my fate<br>
        And then gave up the ball as a defender<br>
        The trick was simply to surrender<br>
        I've been learning 'bout letting go<br>
        How to do it without my claws<br>
        Scratching the surfaces<br>
        I've been learning 'bout wasting time<br>
        And closing some doors<br>
        Hoping to open more, down the line<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        It's okay, it's okay<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>
        Make mistakes, make mistakes<br>

        Friend, old friend, it's 4 AM<br>
        What are we doing in the street?<br>
        I don't want to buy fried chicken<br>
        I wish that I was going to sleep<br>
        And I don't want to kiss you<br>
        Underneath that flashing sign<br>
        What's the hurry? We're not ready<br>
        We've got plenty of time<br>
        Maybe you will get married<br>
        Maybe fall in love<br>
        Could you make me fall asleep<br>
        When you're holding me?<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on<br>
        There's someone else but I twist all of<br>
        His words and he twists mine<br>
        So I'll have to let him go<br>
        We sometimes fit, but we always lie<br>
        And he thinks we could make it work<br>
        But only when he's drunk<br>
        You think you could help me swim<br>
        But I've already sunk<br>
        So maybe you'll get married<br>
        Maybe fall in love<br>
        Could you go on and fall asleep<br>
        When you're not holding me<br>
        Go get set on fire<br>
        Go get set on fire<br>
        Go get set on<br>
        Friend, I am a slow, slow mover<br>
        Friend, I am a slow, slow girl<br>
        Trying to be kind, kind, kinder<br>
        Crawling in another world<br>
        And maybe one day we'll get married<br>
        Maybe fall in love<br>
        Could you make me fall asleep<br>
        When you're holding me?<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on fire<br>
        Try set me on<br>

        <h4>Pasta</h4>
        <h5>Angie McMahon</h5>

        My bedroom is a disaster<br>
        My dog has god kidney failure, failure<br>
        I've been sitting at the bar too much<br>
        Kissin' people in my head<br>
        And saying rubbish things I should not have said<br>
        And they're building things outside my window<br>
        Everywhere I look there's signposts, signposts<br>
        I just sit in my house making noise for fun<br>
        And I'm not moving much or proving much to anyone<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        And I'm feeling tired<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        And I spend so much time eating pasta<br>
        Although I'm probably allergic and other<br>
        People seem to move so much faster<br>
        I wonder why I'm feeling lonely<br>
        When there's plenty of ways to be alone<br>
        I guess I spent all of yesterday on my phone<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        And I'm feeling tired<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        Now I am simultaneously on top of someone's pedestal<br>
        And also underneath someone else's shoe<br>
        Oh, isn't it a shame about the view?<br>
        Can anybody climb aboard this structure I have made to<br>
        Wrap myself around the promise that there is room?<br>
        Oh, isn't it a shame about the view?<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        And now I'm feeling tired<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        But now I'm really trying<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
        But I'm really trying<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost<br>
        I've been lost for a while<br>
